recommended gitlab
1st pull then push
we cannot push in main branch i.e master

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

git init . (use to indicate where it has been initiilized locate repository)
git add    (add all the changes made in repository)
git add . <file name> (add only static file name)
git commit -m "first commit"  (theoritically commit conceptually work as a save or storage purpose)
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/anilghale1/gitlearn.git
git push -u origin main
git pull origin master

git config -- list (List of commands and check whether username and usermail are already exist or not)
git status (list all changes done in repo) (check current status what changes are done over there whether that is commited or not).
clear     (clear the screen)
git log (display all the commited files detect whether commited or not or what is commited)

remote--> github repo 
 add origin--> https://github.com/anilghale1/nayarepo.git
     link from device to server computer

control panel-->user acount-->manage windows

git checkout -b dev  (new branch created) when master branch doesnot work 
git push origin dev  (send repository to the dev branch)

git clone "url"

git branch
git checkout (branch name) (main traansfer branch)
git branch    (check in which branch you are)
git checkout -b develop  (checkout with new branch or created new one)
git checkout dev          (gone to dev branch)
git ceckout -d develop (delete branch not possible frm same branch)

commit works as a report so be sensitive in it

git pull origin dev 
ls--> show file

git checkout branch_name--> clone according to branch name on local server

git clone from other repository --> must create terminal on another folder or simply change branch in which branch collabrator has work on)

git pull origin develop --> fatal error if there is no branch name develop in collaborator
solution to it -->  git push origin master --> it helps to create new branch as well as push file to live repo
